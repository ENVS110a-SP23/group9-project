Background:
Ocean acidification is primarily a man-made consequence of the increased industrial activity that is responsible for
the rise of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Ocean acidification can be measured in pH, which 
represents a logarithmic scale - this is crucial to understanding the degree of acidification, because smaller changes
in recorded pH correspond with a larger increase of acidity. The National Oceanic and Atmsopheric Administration 
estimates that the decrease of surface ocean pH by 0.1 pH units represents a 30% increase in acidity, which has
profound impacts on both the marine and human biosphere. For example, acidification is currently contributing to the 
degradation of calcium deposits, which impairs the maintenance of shells, skeletons, and other calcium carbonate-based
structures. Acidification also intensifies harmful algal blooms and disrupts commercial fishing and surface ocean 
treatments for coastal communities.

Research question:
We plan to research how increased ocean acidification affect the broader coastal ecosystem. This can be  
be broken down into two specific research questions:
1) Is the increase in ocean acidity associated with a net decrease in coastal biodiversity? 
2) What are the socio-economic and health-related impacts of ocean acidification. 
By socio-economic impacts, we are discussing the societal and human impact of ocean and marine health, such as impacts 
on the fishing industry as well as coastal resilience efforts.


Hypothesis and next steps:
We understand that an increase in yearly CO2 emissions is correlated with an average decrease in ocean surface pH.
As oceans continue to become more acidic, we expect our research to confirm a net decrease in coastal biodiversity. 
Additionally, we expect there to be negative impacts to a variety of socio-economic factors. We plan to observe a 
variety of factors including coastal fisheries and the global food chain, and long-term human and marine health. 
Next steps will include dissecting data on the rate of global ocean acidification. We plan to research several case 
studies by region in order to determine the variance in socio-economic impact.

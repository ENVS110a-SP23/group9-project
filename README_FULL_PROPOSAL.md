Background:
Ocean acidification is primarily a man-made consequence of the increased industrial activity that is responsible for
the rise of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Ocean acidification can be measured in pH, which 
represents a logarithmic scale - this is crucial to understanding the degree of acidification, because smaller changes
in recorded pH correspond with a larger increase of acidity. The National Oceanic and Atmsopheric Administration 
estimates that the decrease of surface ocean pH by 0.1 pH units represents a 30% increase in acidity, which has
profound impacts on both the marine and human biosphere. For example, acidification is currently contributing to the 
degradation of calcium deposits, which impairs the maintenance of shells, skeletons, and other calcium carbonate-based
structures. Acidification also intensifies harmful algal blooms and disrupts commercial fishing and surface ocean 
treatments for coastal communities.

Research question:
How does increased ocean acidification affect the broader coastal ecosystem? The "broader coastal ecosystem" can further
be broken down into two specific subtopics: Is the increase in ocean acidity associated with a net decrease in coastal biodiversity?
What about the output of coastal fisheries? How is the increase in ocean acidity associated with coastal communities? What are the
key socioeconomic and health indicators that represent where ocean acidification has impacted economic and climate resilience efforts?

Hypothesis and next steps:
We propose that the increase in yearly CO2 emissions is correlated with an average decrease in ocean surface pH.

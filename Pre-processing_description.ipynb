    "#### 1) Is the increase in ocean acidity associated with a net decrease in coastal biodiversity?\n",
    "#### 2) What are the socio-economic and health-related impacts of ocean acidification.\n",
    "#### By socio-economic impacts, we are discussing the societal and human impact of ocean and marine health, such as impacts on the fishing industry as well as coastal resilience efforts."

The range of data collection is from 1994 to 2020, with discrete measurement sampling. One of the major hypotheses that this study aims to answer is: *changes in seawater CO2-carbonate chemistry and ocean acidification indicators at BATS are the longest record in the global ocean and comparable to the six other globally distributed time-series (Bates et al., 2012; 2014)*, so this dataset is topical to our data analysis and visualization focus. \n",
